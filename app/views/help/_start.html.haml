      Getting Started Guide
    %p
      Welcome to the Illinois Data Bank!  This guide will cover the essential steps for publishing your data.  You can

      at any time to get additional help.

      %h2 Log in with NetID
      %p
        The first step to depositing data within the Illinois Data Bank is logging in with your Illinois NetID and Active Directory password. The Illinois Data Bank will check your NetID and confirm that you belong to a group eligible for self-deposit. Illinois faculty, graduate students, and most staff are eligible for self-deposit, but others (including undergraduates) will see a restriction notice after logging in.
        %a(href="/help#contact" ) Contact the Research Data Service staff
        if you run into trouble or need to request authorization for self-deposit.
    .subgroup(id="describe")
      %h2 Describe
      %p
        The information you provide here will be attached to your dataset as metadata associated with your
        =succeed "." do
          %a(href="help#doi")DOI
        Providing detailed descriptive information is important because it will be transmitted to search engines such as Google Scholar and other aggregators that look at data.  In short, the better you can describe your data the easier it will be for others to find and make use of it!
      %p In a hurry to deposit?  You can always edit and expand your metadata after publication.  Research Data Service staff also regularly review the metadata and add information to increase the visibility of your dataset.
      %p
        %em There are three sections to add information about your dataset:
      %ol
        %li
          %p Description
        %li
          %p Funder
        %li
          %p Related Materials
      %p
        The description area allows you to indicate the authorship information, title, basic information about the contents of your dataset, and an optional release date.  The funder information section allows you to provide grant or other information about financial support of your dataset.  The related materials area is where you can provide information about scholarly works that use or have contributed to your dataset.  Research Data Service staff review this section and create links between these works and your dataset record.  This allows publishers and
        %a(href="http://altmetrics.org/tools/" target="_blank" ) altmetrics tools
        to make connections to your published data.
    .subgroup(id="upload")
      %h2 Upload
      %p This is when you provide us with a copy of the files you'd like to be published and saved within the Illinois Data Bank.  You may either upload directly from your computer or import files you already have stored inside of Box.  Importing files from Box is recommended for larger files.  Depending on your file size, there are sevearl options for uploading your individual data files:
      %ul
        %li
          %p Under 2GB: Use the standard file selection tool, drag-and-drop upload options, or Box import
        %li
          %p Between 2GB and 15GB: Use the Box import tool
        %li
