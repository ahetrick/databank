  %h2 What is copyright?

  %h2 What is a license?

    infringe on the rights held.

  %h2 How does copyright law apply to research data?
  %p
    Datasets are complex objects, and understanding how copyright law applies to datasets is similarly complex.
    Copyright protection does not extend to "facts", and so what researchers often view as their "raw" data are in the
    public domain. Therefore, dataset authors typically cannot claim copyright for raw data. Copyright can apply to
    aspects of a dataset for which an author made creative or editorial decisions about how the raw data is expressed.
    For example, the manner in which data are selected and arranged may be copyrightable. Creators may be able to
    claim copyright over any visualizations, figures, charts, graphs, and other forms of "processing" of research data
    as well.
  %p
    When researchers publish datasets in the Illinois Data Bank the license they assign to their dataset applies only
    to the copyrightable content of the submission. The raw data and any other part of the dataset submission that is
    a part of the public domain cannot be licensed.
  %h2 Why license research data?
  %ul
    %li
      %p To mitigate legal uncertainty for downstream users.
    %li
      %p To control the way you participate in data sharing.
