        These tools can be used to upload files an existing draft dataset in the Illinois Data Bank.
    %h4 What do we mean by a draft dataset?
    .indent
      %p
        A dataset is in a draft state in the Illinois Data Bank after the deposit agreement has been accepted and before the dataset is published or scheduled for publication.  Before uploading a file using any of these options,
        %a(href="/datasets/new" target="_blank" ) create
        or
        %a(href="/datasets" target="_blank" ) find
        your draft dataset, and navigate to the edit form for that dataset.

    %h4 How do I get started?
    .indent
      %p
        At the bottom of the Files section of any draft dataset is a matrix of upload options buttons.
        %br
        Click the
        %em Get token for command line tools
        button to display required elements for use in command line tools.

    %h4 Notes:
    %ul
      %li
        %p A token expires in 3 days, but a new one can be requested using the same method.
      %li
        %p Anyone can use a token to upload a file to this dataset, so keep it secure.
      %li
        %p A distinct token is required for each dataset.
