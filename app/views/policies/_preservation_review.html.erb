  <h1 >Preservation Review, Retention, Deaccession, Revision, and Withdrawal Procedure</h1>
  <hr/>

    <h2>Purpose of this Procedure</h2>

    <p>This document outlines the procedures for reviewing, revising, retaining, Deaccessioning, and Withdrawing Data
      Files, Metadata Files, and Descriptive Metadata published in the Illinois Data Bank.</p>

    <h3>Preservation Review</h3>

    <p>The long-term viability of Datasets published in the Illinois Data Bank will be assessed using a robust set of
      review criteria. The Illinois Data Bank is committed to transparency, accountability, and collaborative
      decision-making regarding assessments of the long-term preservation status of research data. While a variety of
      unique factors influence decisions made about the Disposition of Datasets, the criteria outlined in the
      <a href="#preservation_guidelines">Preservation Review Guidelines</a> provide a basis for assessing Datasets.</p>

    <h3>Preservation Review Roles and Responsibilities</h3>

    <p>Assessment decisions are a shared responsibility and are often influenced by discipline-specific factors. The
      Research Data Service staff are responsible for developing and leading the assessment process of Datasets and will
      consult with ad hoc "Assessment Teams" comprising functional and subject specialists as well as domain experts
      outside of the Library as appropriate. The "Assessment Team" may also incorporate input from other stakeholders as
      necessary.</p>

    <h3>Retention</h3>

    <p>The Illinois Data Bank anticipates that the majority of Preservation Reviews will result in Dataset retention.
      The decision to retain a Dataset will typically indicate that the preservation viability of the Dataset is
      acceptable given the determined long-term value of the Dataset, and that Illinois Data Bank resources being deployed
      to steward the Dataset are at a level that is proportional to its long-term value. </p>

    <p>The Illinois Data Bank will commit resources to escalating preservation efforts for Datasets determined to have
      remarkable value that are suffering preservation risk or are not available in the most usable states. Examples of
      escalated preservation procedures include file format migration, enhancing Descriptive Metadata/Metadata Files, or
      improving access and/or use services by developing data-type-specific viewers/emulators.</p>

    <h3>Deaccession</h3>

    <p>A decision to Deaccession the Data Files and/or Metadata Files associated with a Dataset will only occur if it is
      determined that the Dataset is not of long-term value to its research community and/or its inclusion in the
      Illinois Data Bank detrimentally affects the Illinois Data Bank's ability to steward effectively other resources
      whose research value and preservation viability are evident.</p>
    <p>Upon deciding to Deaccession the Data Files and/or Metadata Files associated with a Dataset, the Illinois Data Bank
    will consider one of these options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Transfer to a repository more appropriately situated to steward the Data Files and/or Metadata
        Files.</p></li>
      <li><p>Transfer Data Files and/or Metadata Files back to the Long-Term Contact Person indicated in the
        Descriptive Metadata.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For any Data Files and/or Metadata Files that are to be Deaccessioned, a good faith effort to contact the
      Long-Term Contact Person will be made by notifying them at the email address the Illinois Data Bank has on record.
      The notification will outline the Illinois Data Bank's Deaccessioning decision.</p>

    <p>If the Illinois Data Bank does not receive a response from the Long-Term Contact Person after 90 days, the
      Illinois Data Bank will transfer or discard the Data Files and/or Metadata Files according to the practices and
      security standards in place at the time of Deaccessioning.</p>

    <p>The Illinois Data Bank will not Deaccession any Data Files and/or Metadata Files before the initial commitment
      period ends, currently five years. </p>

    <h3>Descriptive Metadata</h3>

    <p>The Illinois Data Bank currently plans to retain Descriptive Metadata persistently for all Datasets deposited in
      the Illinois Data Bank regardless of the Disposition of Data File(s) and/or Metadata File(s) except in rare
      circumstances as determined by the Director of the Research Data Service.</p>

    <h3>Revisions</h3>

    <p>Depositors are expected to confirm the validity of all content prior to publishing a Dataset. However, should an
      error in the Descriptive Metadata be discovered, the original Depositor or Research Data Service staff may make a
      revision to the Descriptive Metadata, which is tracked via a public change log. </p>

    <p>If a Creator of a Dataset finds that a file in their published Dataset contains an error, they must contact the
      Research Data Service staff to submit the corrected file. A new version of the entire Dataset will be created and
      a new DOI will be assigned. Research Data Service staff will see that the Descriptive Metadata associated with the
      Dataset makes apparent which version is most recent and what changes occurred. Research Data Service staff will refer
      to the <a href="#withdrawal_guidelines">Illinois Data Bank Withdrawal Guidelines</a> when determining whether to
      remove the erroneous Dataset from public view. Depositors are expected to limit the need for versioning by not
      publishing erroneous Datasets; as such, Datasets are limited to no more than six versions.</p>

    <h3>Withdrawal of Deposited Datasets</h3>

    <p>The Illinois Data Bank may Withdraw a published Dataset from the repository before the current five year
      commitment period ends for a compelling reason. Compelling reasons include, but are not limited to, failure to
      meet the Criteria for Depositing outlined in the
      <a href="#accession_policy">Illinois Data Bank Accession Policy</a>, detection of malware in deposited files,
      violations of copyright or publisher policy, violations of contracts (e.g., Nondisclosure Agreement, Material
      Transfer Agreement, etc.), research misconduct (e.g., plagiarism, fabrication or falsification of data, etc.),
      legal requirements, national security, or situations that violate the University Code of Conduct. </p>

    <p>Datasets may not be Withdrawn because the Depositor or Creator is moving to another institution. Creators have
      the right to provide additional copies to other institutions under the non-exclusive Deposit Agreement.</p>

    <p>All Withdrawal requests must be submitted to <a
    href="mailto:databank@library.illinois.edu"
    >databank@library.illinois.edu</a>. These will be reviewed by Research Data Service staff who may contact the
      requestor for more information. If the request is submitted by a third party or the decision to Withdraw is made
      by the Research Data Service staff, the Long-Term Contact Person and the Depositor will be notified of the request
      via the email addresses the Illinois Data Bank has on record. Research Data Service staff are not responsible for
      resolving legal disputes, but will refer University of Illinois community members to the University of Illinois
      Office of University Counsel at <a
    href="http://www.legal.uillinois.edu/">http://www.legal.uillinois.edu/</a> as necessary.</p>

    <p>At minimum, Data Files and/or Metadata Files associated with a Withdrawn Dataset are removed from the public view
      and are no longer available for download. Research Data Service staff will add a statement of Withdrawal to the
      associated Dataset's Descriptive Metadata. In many cases, Withdrawal results in suppression of public access
      to Data Files and/or Metadata Files, even when the entire Dataset will be retained within our systems for the sake of
      provenance. In rarer cases, the Research Data Service staff may be compelled to delete all or part of a Dataset altogether. The Research Data
      Service staff will refer to the <a href="#withdrawal_guidelines">Illinois Data Bank Withdrawal Guidelines</a> to
      respond to the varying circumstances under which Withdrawal may occur. </p>

    <h3>Withdrawal of Dataset Drafts</h3>

    <p>In order to ensure sustainability of technological and storage resources, the Research Data Service staff retain
      the right to delete initiated Datasets that have remained in draft state in the Illinois Data Bank in excess of 12
      months. A good faith effort to contact the Depositor via the email address on record in the Illinois Data Bank
      will be made prior to deletion.</p>
