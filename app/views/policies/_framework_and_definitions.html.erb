      <h3>About the Illinois Data Bank</h3>

      <p>The Illinois Data Bank is a file-based repository for research data at the University of Illinois at
        Urbana-Champaign. The Research Data Service and associated staff, located within the University Library, assumes
        responsibility for the operation and policies of the Illinois Data Bank.</p>

      <p>The Illinois Data Bank's mission is to centralize, preserve, and provide persistent and reliable access to the
        research data created by affiliates of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, such as its faculty,
        academic staff, and graduate students. The Illinois Data Bank is intended to be responsive to the Illinois
        research community, is supported by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and endeavors to be both
        durable and sustainable. The Illinois Data Bank is a platform for making Datasets created from research projects
        by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign researchers publicly accessible by seeing that the research data
        is both widely discoverable and linked to associated works, such as journal articles, source code, or data
        deposited elsewhere. Depositing research data into the Illinois Data Bank is voluntary.</p>

      <p>The Illinois Data Bank is intended to provide maximum public access to unrestricted research data for the
        advancement of scholarship and the public good in ways that are consistent with the U.S. President's Office of
        Science and Technology Policy <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043850/https:/www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf"
      >("OSTP") Public Access Memo</a> of 2013. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign maintains its commitment
        to seeing that restricted data are not inappropriately or inadvertently disclosed, consistent with all
        requirements pertaining to the collection, storage, access, use, transmission, and disposal of sensitive data.
        Researchers are obligated to be vigilant in seeing that such restricted data is not made publicly accessible
        through the Illinois Data Bank or any other unmediated public access mechanism.</p>

      <h3>Illinois Data Bank Policies</h3>

      <p>The following policy documents govern the obligations of the Illinois Data Bank service and users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#access_and_use">Access and Use Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="#accession_policy">Accession Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="#deposit_agreement">Deposit Agreement</a></li>
        <li><a href="#preservation_policy">Preservation Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="#proceedures">Preservation Review, Revision, Retention, Deaccession and Withdrawal Procedure</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Review of Policies</h3>

      <p>The Illinois Data Bank policies are intended to be dynamic and flexible documents, responsive to changes in the
        academic environment and attentive to the work of other campus units and programs such as IDEALS, the University
        Archives, the Records &amp; Information Management Services, Technology Services, the Office of the Vice
        Chancellor of Research, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. The Research Data Service staff
        will review all policies on a quarterly basis during the Illinois Data Bank's first year (May 2016-May 2017). In
        subsequent years, the policies will be reviewed as needed, but at least annually. All past versions of each
        policy will be maintained in IDEALS. The Research Data Service will strive to see that any Dataset deposited in
        the Illinois Data Bank remain subject to the Illinois Data Bank policies that are in place on the date the
        Depositor of that Dataset accepts the Deposit Agreement. The Director of the Research Data Service manages the
        Illinois Data Bank policies, including the approving of any revisions and/or exceptions to these policies.</p>
