  <h3>Purpose of this Policy</h3>

  <p>This document explains what the Illinois Data Bank can accept for publication.</p>

  <h3>Criteria for Depositing</h3>

  <p>Datasets deposited into the Illinois Data Bank must either be generated through the course of a research project
    or deposited with an expectation that public availability will allow the Dataset to be used for research purposes.
    Research data is defined through the federal Office of Management and Budget 2 CFR Part 215 â€“ Uniform
    Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and other
    Non-Profit Organizations (OMB Circular A-110) (<a
  href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/circulars/a110/2cfr215-0.pdf"
  >https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/circulars/a110/2cfr215-0.pdf</a>) as:</p>

  <p>
    <em>"(i) Research data is defined as the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the (scientific) community
      as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, drafts of
      (scientific) papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues. This 'recorded'
      material excludes physical objects (e.g., laboratory samples). Research data also do not include:</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>
      <em>(A) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a researcher until
        they are published, or similar information which is protected under law; and</em></p></li>
    <li><p>
      <em>(B) Personnel and medical information and similar information the disclosure of which would constitute a
        clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, such as information that could be used to identify a
        particular person in a research study."</em></p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In nearly all circumstances, only Datasets, consisting of Data Files together with the associated Descriptive
    Metadata and any associated Metadata Files, are deposited into the Illinois Data Bank. However, there may be rare
    circumstances where approval is given by the Director of the Research Data Service to deposit a Dataset consisting
    of just Metadata File(s) and associated Descriptive Metadata.</p>

  <p>Datasets deposited in the Illinois Data Bank must meet the following criteria: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="nudge-left-12">&bull;</span> While Datasets need not be exclusively created at the University of
        Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, at
        least one researcher from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus with an active NetID must have
        made, conceived, reduced to practice, authored or otherwise made a substantive intellectual contribution to
        the creation of the Dataset. </p></li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="nudge-left-12">&bull;</span> Datasets must be deposited for open, public access, which means that
        anyone may download and reuse all
        or part of a Dataset in accordance with the license indicated by the Depositor. Depositors may define a
        Publication Delay Period (also known as an Embargo Period) with a maximum Publication Delay Period of 12 months,
        except on rare occasions where the Director of the Research Data Service can consider a longer Publication
        Delay Period based upon extenuating circumstances, such as for the purpose of seeking patent protection.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="nudge-left-12">&bull;</span> Datasets must only contain unrestricted content with
        <strong>NO</strong> private, confidential, or
        other legally protected information.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="nudge-left-12">&bull;</span> The Depositor must have or be able to furnish on demand the rights or
        permissions to share any part of
        a Dataset obtained from a third party. It is the responsibility of the Depositor to have the necessary rights
        or permissions to share any content not generated by the Depositor.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="nudge-left-12">&bull;</span> The maximum total size of deposited Datasets cannot exceed 2 TB per
        University of Illinois at
        Urbana-Champaign faculty member or Principal Investigator in a given 12-month period unless the Director of
        the Research Data Service has approved special arrangements.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="nudge-left-12">&bull;</span> Data Files must be deposited with Descriptive Metadata to facilitate
        discovery of the Datasets.
        Depositors are strongly encouraged to deposit Metadata Files along with Data Files and Descriptive Metadata
        that meet minimum standards as outlined in the
        <a href="/help#dataset_documentation">Illinois Data Bank Help section: Dataset Documentation</a> to facilitate
        interpretation and reuse of the Data Files.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="nudge-left-12">&bull;</span> A Long-Term Contact Person, similar to a "corresponding author," who
        is knowledgeable about the
        Dataset and assumes responsibility for its validity must be identified in a Dataset's Descriptive Metadata
        before publication of the Dataset.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="nudge-left-12">&bull;</span> The Dataset must be in a final state that is not subject to revisions
        or updates. </p></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Quality Control</h3>

  <p>The Illinois Data Bank does not attempt to judge the scholarly quality of the Dataset. The Research Data Service
    staff trust the judgment and
    research expertise of those who created and deposited it. Thus a determination of the research quality is at the
    discretion of, and also the responsibility of, the Long-Term Contact Person, as named in the Descriptive
    Metadata. </p>

  <p>Research Data Service staff may review Datasets for alignment with criteria for depositing and/or to extend the
    Descriptive Metadata as needed to facilitate greater accuracy and discoverability. For more information on the
    curatorial review process please see the
    <a href="/help#curation_review_process">Illinois Data Bank Curation Review Process</a> document. </p>

  <h3>Discovery and Access</h3>

  <p>Each Dataset published in the Illinois Data Bank is given a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) that is registered in
    a global registry of resources with DataCite (<a href="https://www.datacite.org/">https://www.datacite.org/</a>).
    Likewise, Illinois Data Bank webpages
    and Descriptive Metadata records are intended to be optimized for search engine visibility. This enables discovery
    via web searches (e.g., Google) and Descriptive Metadata aggregating services. For more information, see the
    <a href="http://databank.illinois.edu/policies#access_and_use">Illinois Data Bank Access and Use Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Depositors have the option of defining a Publication Delay Period for all or part of a Dataset for a maximum of
    12 months, except on rare occasions where the Director of the Research Data Service may consider a longer
    Publication Delay Period based upon extenuating circumstances, such as for the purpose of seeking patent
    protection. There are currently two options for delaying publication:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>1) "File Only Delay", which delays publication of Data Files and/or Metadata Files only</p></li>
    <li><p>2) "Full Dataset Delay", which delays publication of Data Files and/or Metadata Files and Descriptive
      Metadata </p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more information about the data publication delay options, see the
    <a href="/help#embargo">Illinois Data Bank Help section:
      Delaying publication in the Illinois Data Bank</a>.</p>

  <h3>Copyright, Intellectual Property, and Digital Rights</h3>

  <p>The Illinois Data Bank relies on the directives regarding copyright found in Article III of the General Rules
    Concerning University Organization and Procedures (<a
  href="http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/general-rules"
  >http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/general-rules</a>) and the campus Illinois Copyright Policy (<a
  href="http://copyright.illinois.edu/"
  >http://copyright.illinois.edu/</a>). The management of digital rights associated with the Illinois Data Bank will
    be developed in ways that are consistent with University policy and legal requirements.</p>

  <h3>Illinois Data Bank Commitment to Published Datasets</h3>

  <p>The Illinois Data Bank commits to preserving published Datasets in accordance with the
    <a href="http://databank.illinois.edu/policies#preservation_policy">Illinois Data Bank
      Preservation Policy</a>.
    The Illinois Data Bank also currently commits to providing public access through maintenance of persistent
    Illinois Data Bank webpages, Descriptive Metadata records, and identifiers, and to providing access metrics, which
    may include page-views, downloads, and citations. The Illinois Data Bank currently commits to this level of
    preservation, access, and reporting for a period of <strong>at least five years</strong> from the date of
    publication via the Illinois Data Bank. The Illinois Data Bank will endeavor to retain the published Datasets
    beyond the initial commitment, but reserves the right to assess the long-term viability of Datasets through a
    review process to determine whether to maintain the Dataset beyond the initial five-year commitment. The potential
    outcomes of the review process are outlined in the
    <a href="#preservation_review">Preservation Review, Revision, Retention, Deaccession, and Withdrawal Procedure</a>.
  </p>

  <p>To learn how to increase the likelihood that published Datasets will be preserved beyond the initial five-year
    commitment, please see the
    <a href="#preservation_guidelines">Illinois Data Bank Preservation Review Guidelines</a>.</p>
